# Pagination
Created a simple pagination project which has some pages and table, there are two different search input one is "Search with Name" and another one is "Search with Position" these 
searches are done in the entire table and show the data when matched, and if no data is matched then we get a error display says "No data found". 
Used CSS to improve the UI of the page.
